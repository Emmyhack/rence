# Hemat — USDT-Powered DeFi Thrift & Insurance Platform Implementation Summary

Version: 1.0  
Implementation Date: January 2025  
Blockchain: Kaia Network  
Status: MVP Complete

## 🎯 Overview

Hemat is a comprehensive DeFi-native thrift savings and insurance protocol that combines traditional communal thrift models (Ajo/Esusu) with modern blockchain infrastructure. The platform is built on Kaia blockchain using USDT as the canonical unit for stability and features automated smart contracts, yield optimization, and transparent insurance pools.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Smart Contracts (Solidity)
- **HematFactory**: Main factory contract for creating and managing groups
- **HematGroup**: Individual group contracts with three thrift models
- **EscrowVault**: Treasury management with automated yield deployment
- **StakeManager**: Member stake and trust score management
- **InsurancePool**: Community insurance fund with claims processing
- **MockDeFiAdapter**: Yield generation interface (8% APY simulation)

### Backend (Node.js + Express)
- **RESTful API**: Comprehensive endpoints for groups, users, contributions, insurance
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Full schema with Prisma ORM
- **Blockchain Integration**: Real-time event monitoring and transaction handling
- **WebSocket Support**: Live updates for group activities
- **Security Features**: JWT auth, rate limiting, input validation

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- **Modern UI**: Vite, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion animations
- **Web3 Integration**: Wagmi, RainbowKit wallet connection
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit with persistence
- **Real-time Updates**: Socket.io integration for live data
